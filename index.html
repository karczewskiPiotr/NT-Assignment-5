            <h2>Domain Name System</h2>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or
                other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with
                domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more
                readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying
                computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.
            </p>
            <h3>Top level domains</h3>
            <h4>Types of top-level domains:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Infrastructure top-level domain</b> (ARPA): This group consists of one domain, the Address and
                    Routing Parameter Area.
                </li>
                <li><b>Generic top-level domains</b> (gTLD): Top-level domains with three or more characters</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Restricted generic top-level domains</b> (grTLD): These domains are managed under official ICANN
                    accredited registrars.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sponsored top-level domains</b> (sTLD): These domains are proposed and sponsored by private
                    agencies or organizations that establish and enforce rules restricting the eligibility to use the
                    TLD. Use is based on community theme concepts; these domains are managed under official ICANN
                    accredited registrars.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Country-code top-level domains</b> (ccTLD): Two-letter domains established for countries or
                    territories. With some historical exceptions, the code for any territory is the same as its
                    two-letter ISO 3166 code.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Internationalized country code top-level domains</b> (IDN ccTLD): ccTLDs in non-Latin
                            character sets (e.g., Arabic, Cyrillic, Hebrew, or Chinese).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Test top-level domains</b> (tTLD): These domains were installed under .test for testing purposes
                    in the IDN development process; these domains are not present in the root zone.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Examples of top-level domains:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>.com</b> - an open TLD. Any person or entity is permitted to register.</li>
                <li><b>,org</b> - an open TLD. Any person or entity is permitted to register.</li>
                <li><b>.net</b> - an open TLD. Any person or entity is permitted to register.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>int</b> - strictly limited to organizations, offices, and programs endorsed by a treaty between
                    two or more nations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>.edu</b> - limited to specific higher educational institutions such as, but not limited to, trade
                    schools and universities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>.gov</b> - limited to United States governmental entities and agencies as well as qualifying
                    state, county and local municipal government agencies.
                </li>
                <li><b>.mil</b> - limited to use by the United States military.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>DNS Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>
                Domain Names are hierarchical and each part of a domain name is referred to as either the root, top
                level, second level or as a sub-domain. To allow computers to properly recognize a fully qualified
                domain name, dots are placed between each part of the name. All resolvers treat dots as separators
                between the parts of the domain name. The fully qualified domain name is split into pieces at the dots
                and the tree is searched starting from the root of the hierarchichal tree structure. All resolvers start
                their lookups at the root, therefore the root is represented by a dot and is often assumed to be there,
                even when not shown. The resolver navigates it's way down the tree until it gets to the last, left-most
                part of the domain name and then looks within that location for the information it needs. Information
                about a host such as its name, its IP address and occasionally even it's function are stored in one or
                more zone files which together compose a larger zone often referred to as a domain.
            </p>
            <img src="images/dns-hierarchy.png" alt="" />
            <p>
                Within the hierarchy, you will start resolution at the top level domain, work your way down to the
                second-level domain, then through zero, one or more sub-domains until you get to the actual host name
                you want to resolve into an IP address.
            </p>
            <h3>DNS Queries</h3>
            <p>There are three types of queries in the DNS system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Recursive Query</h4>
                    <p>
                        In a recursive query, a DNS client provides a hostname, and the DNS Resolver “must” provide an
                        answer—it responds with either a relevant resource record, or an error message if it can't be
                        found. The resolver starts a recursive query process, starting from the DNS Root Server, until
                        it finds the Authoritative Name Server (for more on Authoritative Name Servers see DNS Server
                        Types below) that holds the IP address and other information for the requested hostname.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Iterative Query</h4>
                    <p>
                        In an iterative query, a DNS client provides a hostname, and the DNS Resolver returns the best
                        answer it can. If the DNS resolver has the relevant DNS records in its cache, it returns them.
                        If not, it refers the DNS client to the Root Server, or another Authoritative Name Server which
                        is nearest to the required DNS zone. The DNS client must then repeat the query directly against
                        the DNS server it was referred to.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Non-Recursive Query</h4>
                    <p>
                        A non-recursive query is a query in which the DNS Resolver already knows the answer. It either
                        immediately returns a DNS record because it already stores it in local cache, or queries a DNS
                        Name Server which is authoritative for the record, meaning it definitely holds the correct IP
                        for that hostname. In both cases, there is no need for additional rounds of queries (like in
                        recursive or iterative queries). Rather, a response is immediately returned to the client.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>DNS Delegation</h3>
            <p>
                The DNS gives you the option to separate the namespace into different DNS zones. You can seve them, copy
                them or distribute it to other DNS servers. There are few reasons to do it:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You would like to load balance by dividing one large zone into more, smaller zones. This will
                    increase the DNS resolution and add extra security.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You desire to delegate management of part of your DNS namespace to another location or department in
                    your organization.
                </li>
                <li>Use the DNS Delegation for adding various subdomains. Use them for different purposes.</li>
                <li>Delegate control of part of your DNS namespace to another location.</li>
                <li>
                    You can restructure your namespace and make other DNS servers responsible for a part of the whole
                    information.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When you create new DNS zone, you must have delegation records in other zones that point toward the
                authoritative DNS servers for the new one.
            </p>
            <p>
                The resource record information of the new DNS zone will be stored in a DNS server, which will be the
                primary master for that zone. You can improve the security and duplicate the zone information to another
                DNS server, later on.
            </p>
            <h3>DNS Record</h3>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System specifies a set of various types of resource records (RRs), which are the basic
                information elements of the domain name system. Each record has a type (name and number), an expiration
                time (time to live), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as
                a resource record set (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver
                to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement round-robin ordering to achieve load
                balancing. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of
                resource record in canonical order.
            </p>
            <h4>Resource record fields:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>NAME</b> - Name of the node to which this record pertains. It's length is variable.</li>
                <li><b>TYPE</b> - Type of RR in numeric form. It lenght is 2 octets.</li>
                <li><b>CLASS</b> - Class code. It's legth is 2 octets.</li>
                <li><b>TTL</b> - Count of seconds that the RR stays valid. It's value is 4 octets.</li>
                <li><b>RDLENGHT</b> - Length of RDATA field (specified in octets). Its length is 2.</li>
                <li><b>RDATA</b> - Additional PR-specific data. It's is RDLENGHT.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>DNS Record Types:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Address Mapping record (A Record)</b> - also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and
                    its corresponding IPv4 address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>IP Version 6 Address record (AAAA Record)</b> - stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6
                    address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Canonical Name record (CNAME Record)</b> - can be used to alias a hostname to another hostname.
                    When a DNS client requests a record that contains a CNAME, which points to another hostname, the DNS
                    resolution process is repeated with the new hostname.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Mail exchanger record (MX Record)</b> - specifies an SMTP email server for the domain, used to
                    route outgoing emails to an email server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Name Server records (NS Record)</b> - specifies that a DNS Zone, such as “example.com” is
                    delegated to a specific Authoritative Name Server, and provides the address of the name server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Reverse-lookup Pointer records (PTR Record)</b> - allows a DNS resolver to provide an IP address
                    and receive a hostname (reverse DNS lookup).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Certificate record (CERT Record)</b> - stores encryption certificates—PKIX, SPKI, PGP, and so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Service Location (SRV Record)</b> - a service location record, like MX but for other
                    communication protocols.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Text Record (TXT Record)</b> - typically carries machine-readable data such as opportunistic
                    encryption, sender policy framework, DKIM, DMARC, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Start of Authority (SOA Record)</b> - this record appears at the beginning of a DNS zone file,
                    and indicates the Authoritative Name Server for the current DNS zone, contact details for the domain
                    administrator, domain serial number, and information on how frequently DNS information for this zone
                    should be refreshed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reverse DNS</h3>
            <p>
                In computer networks, a reverse DNS lookup or reverse DNS resolution (rDNS) is the querying of the
                Domain Name System (DNS) to determine the domain name associated with an IP address. he process of
                reverse resolving an IP address uses PTR records. The reverse DNS database of the Internet is rooted in
                the arpa top-level domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the informational RFC 1912[1] (Section 2.1) recommends that "every Internet-reachable host
                should have a name" and that "for every IP address, there should be a matching PTR record," it is not an
                Internet Standard requirement, and not all IP addresses have a reverse entry.
            </p>
            <h3>Non-authoritative Answer</h3>
            <p>
                Non-authoritative name servers do not contain original source files of domain’s zone. They have a cache
                file for the domains that is constructed from all the DNS lookups done previously. If a DNS server
                responded for a DNS query, which doesn’t have original file, is known as a Non-authoritative answer.
            </p>
            <h3>Authoritative Answer</h3>
            <p>
                An authoritative name server is a name server that has the original source files of a domain zone files.
                The is where domain administrator has configured the DNS records for a domain. Authoritative DNS server
                can be master DNS server or its slaves. If you directly query to these DNS servers, they will return
                authoritative answer because they have the original files of domain zone.
            </p>
            <h3>DNS Resolver</h3>
            <p>
                Domain name resolvers determine the domain name servers responsible for the domain name in question by a
                sequence of queries starting with the right-most (top-level) domain label. DNS resolvers are classified
                by a variety of query methods, such as recursive, non-recursive, and iterative.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>non-recursive query</b> - resolver queries a DNS server that provides a record either for which
                    the server is authoritative, or it provides a partial result without querying other servers. In case
                    of a caching DNS resolver, the non-recursive query of its local DNS cache delivers a result and
                    reduces the load on upstream DNS servers by caching DNS request records for a period of time after
                    an initial response from upstream DNS servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>recursiver query</b> - resolver queries a single DNS server, which may in turn query other DNS
                    servers on behalf of the requester. For example, a simple stub resolver running on a home router
                    typically makes a recursive query to the DNS server run by the user's ISP. A recursive query is one
                    for which the DNS server answers the query completely by querying other name servers as needed. In
                    typical operation, a client issues a recursive query to a caching recursive DNS server, which
                    subsequently issues non-recursive queries to determine the answer and send a single answer back to
                    the client. The resolver, or another DNS server acting recursively on behalf of the resolver,
                    negotiates use of recursive service using bits in the query headers. DNS servers are not required to
                    support recursive queries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>iterative query</b> - resolver queries a chain of one or more DNS servers. Each server refers the
                    client to the next server in the chain, until the current server can fully resolve the request. For
                    example, a possible resolution of www.example.com would query a global root server, then a "com"
                    server, and finally an "example.com" server.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <!--
        <p>
            Assuming the resolver has no cached records to accelerate the process, the resolution process starts with a
            query to one of the root servers. In typical operation, the root servers do not answer directly, but
            respond with a referral to more authoritative servers, e.g., a query for "www.wikipedia.org" is referred to
            the org servers. The resolver now queries the servers referred to, and iteratively repeats this process
            until it receives an authoritative answer. The diagram illustrates this process for the host that is named
            by the fully qualified domain name "www.wikipedia.org".

            This mechanism would place a large traffic burden on the root servers, if every resolution on the Internet
            required starting at the root. In practice caching is used in DNS servers to off-load the root servers, and
            as a result, root name servers actually are involved in only a relatively small fraction of all requests.

            <h3>DNS Caching</h3>
            <p>
                To improve efficiency, reduce DNS traffic across the Internet, and increase performance in end-user
                applications, the Domain Name System supports DNS cache servers which store DNS query results for a
                period of time determined in the configuration (time-to-live) of the domain name record in question.
                Typically, such caching DNS servers also implement the recursive algorithm necessary to resolve a given
                name starting with the DNS root through to the authoritative name servers of the queried domain. With
                this function implemented in the name server, user applications gain efficiency in design and operation.
            </p>
            <h3>file: /etc/hosts</h3>
            <p>
                Modifying your hosts file enables you to override the domain name system (DNS) for a domain on a
                specific machine. DNS management is useful when you want to test your site without the test link prior
                to going live with SSL, verify that an alias site works prior to DNS changes, and for other DNS-related
                reasons.

                This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each entry should be kept on an
                individual line. The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host
                name. The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one space.

            <h2>Mail system</h2>
            <h3>Protocols:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)</b> - a mail access protocol used by a client application to read
                    messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the server. POP supports
                    simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP
                    RFC's).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</b> - provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple
                    devices. Small portable devices like smartphones are increasingly used to check email while
                    travelling, and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to
                    reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the
                    device needs to request to download specific messages. Usually mail is left in folders in the mail
                    server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)</b> - used by Microsoft Outlook to communicate
                    to Microsoft Exchange Server - and to a range of other email server products such as Axigen Mail
                    Server, Kerio Connect, Scalix, Zimbra, HP OpenMail, IBM Lotus Notes, Zarafa, and Bynari where
                    vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</b> - an Internet standard for email transmission. First
                    defined by RFC 821 in 1982, it was updated in 2008 with Extended SMTP additions by RFC 5321; which
                    is the protocol in widespread use today. Mail servers and other mail transfer agents use SMTP to
                    send and receive mail messages on TCP port 25. Although proprietary systems such as Microsoft
                    Exchange and IBM Notes and webmail systems such as Outlook.com, Gmail and Yahoo! Mail may use their
                    own non-standard protocols internally, all use SMTP when sending or receiving email from outside
                    their own systems.

            <h3>Basic commands</h3>
            <h4>Invoking Mail To Send Messages</h4>
            <p>To invoke the UNIX mail utility program to send messages, type</p>
            <p><code>mailx email-names</code></p>
            <p>or</p>
            <p><code>mailx -s subject email-names</code></p>
            <p>
                where email-names is a list of electronic mail names of people to whom you wish to send the message and
                subject is the subject (or title) of the message being sent. The email name may be as simple as name or
                name@machine or may require the name followed by a fully qualified host/domain name (e.g.
                name@CS.ColoState.Edu). If the mailx command does not prompt you for a subject (which is nice to include
                for the receiver of the mail), it can be included with the -s option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tilde escapes are entered at the start of a text line (when entering mail message text) to perform some
                useful operations. Hit the Return key after entering a tilde escape sequence/command.

                An email box (also email mailbox, e-mailbox) is the destination to which electronic mail messages are
                delivered. It is the equivalent of a letter box in the postal system.
            </p>
            <h4>Aliases</h4>
            <p>
                Aliases are additional names of mailboxes. You can use them to assign multiple addresses to a single
                mailbox. For example, you can add the advertising@ alias for an employee who manages advertising. After
                this, emails sent to the addresses advertising@yourdomain.com will be delivered to this employee's
                mailbox.
            </p>
            <h4>Address</h4>
            <p>
                An email address identifies an email box to which email messages are delivered. An email address such as
                John.Smith@example.com is made up of a local-part, an @ symbol, then a case-insensitive domain. Although
                the standard requires[1] the local part to be case-sensitive, it also urges that receiving hosts deliver
                messages in a case-independent fashion,[2] e.g., that the mail system at example.com treat John.Smith as
                equivalent to john.smith; some mail systems even treat them as equivalent to johnsmith.[3] Mail systems
                often limit their users' choice of name to a subset of the technically valid characters, and in some
                cases also limit which addresses it is possible to send mail to.
            </p>
            <h3>E-mail structure</h3>
            <h4>Message header</h4>
            <p>
                Each message has exactly one header (the "header section" of the message, according to the
                specification), which is structured into fields ("header fields"). Each field has a name ("field name"
                or "header field name") and a value ("field body" or "header field body").
            </p>
            <p>
                nformally, each line of text in the header that begins with a non-whitespace printable character begins
                a separate field. The field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the
                <b>separator</b> character ":". The separator is then followed by the field value (the "body" of the
                field). The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first
                character.
            </p>
            <p>The message header must include at least the following fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>From:</b> The email address, and optionally the name of the author(s). In many email clients not
                    changeable except through changing account settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Date:</b> The local time and date when the message was written. Like the From: field, many email
                    clients fill this in automatically when sending. The recipient's client may then display the time in
                    the format and time zone local to them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Common header fields for email include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>To:</b> The email address(es), and optionally name(s) of the message's recipient(s). Indicates
                    primary recipients (multiple allowed), for secondary recipients see Cc: and Bcc: below.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Subject:</b> A brief summary of the topic of the message. Certain abbreviations are commonly used
                    in the subject, including "RE:" and "FW:".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cc: Carbon coply:</b> Many email clients will mark email in one's inbox differently depending on
                    whether they are in the To: or Cc: list. (Bcc: Blind carbon copy; addresses are usually only
                    specified during SMTP delivery, and not usually listed in the message header.)
                </li>
                <li><b>Content-Type:</b> Information about how the message is to be displayed, usually a MIME type.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Precedence:</b> commonly with values "bulk", "junk", or "list"; used to indicate that automated
                    "vacation" or "out of office" responses should not be returned for this mail, e.g. to prevent
                    vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list. Sendmail uses this
                    field to affect prioritization of queued email, with "Precedence: special-delivery" messages
                    delivered sooner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Message-ID:</b> Also an automatically generated field; used to prevent multiple delivery and for
                    reference in In-Reply-To: (see below).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>In-Reply-To:</b> Message-ID of the message that this is a reply to. Used to link related messages
                    together. This field only applies for reply messages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>References:</b> Message-ID of the message that this is a reply to, and the message-id of the
                    message the previous reply was a reply to, etc.
                </li>
                <li><b>Reply-To:</b> Address that should be used to reply to the message.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sender:</b> Address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From: field
                    (secretary, list manager, etc.).
                </li>
                <li><b>Archived-At:</b> A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Attachment</h3>
            <p>
                An email attachment is a computer file sent along with an email message. One or more files can be
                attached to any email message, and be sent along with it to the recipient. This is typically used as a
                simple method to share documents and images. A paper clip icon is the standard indicator for an
                attachment in an email client.
            </p>
            <p>
                Email standards such as MIME don't specify any file size limits, but in practice email users will find
                that they can't successfully send very large files across the Internet. This is because of a number of
                potential limits:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mail systems often arbitrarily limit the size their users are allowed to submit.</li>
                <li>
                    A message will often pass through several mail transfer agents to reach the recipient. Each of these
                    has to store the message before forwarding it on, and may therefore also impose size limits.
                </li>
                <li>The recipient mail system may reject incoming emails with attachments over a certain size.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The result is that while large attachments may succeed internally within a company or organization, they
                may not when sending across the Internet.
            </p>
            <h3>Content encoding</h3>
            <p>
                Internet email was originally designed for 7-bit ASCII.[51] Most email software is 8-bit clean but must
                assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The MIME standard introduced character
                set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: quoted
                printable for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary
                binary data. The 8BITMIME and BINARY extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without
                the need for these encodings, but many mail transport agents still do not support them fully. In some
                countries, several encoding schemes coexist; as the result, by default, the message in a non-Latin
                alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is coincidence, when the sender and
                receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international character sets, Unicode is growing
                in popularity.
            </p>
            <h3>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)</h3>
            <p>
                Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is an Internet standard that extends the format of email to
                support:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Text in character sets other than ASCII</li>
                <li>Non-text attachments: audio, video, images, application programs etc.</li>
                <li>Message bodies with multiple parts</li>
                <li>Header information in non-ASCII character sets</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mailing list</h3>
            <p>
                An electronic mailing list or email list is a special use of email that allows for widespread
                distribution of information to many Internet users. It is similar to a traditional mailing list – a list
                of names and addresses – as might be kept by an organization for sending publications to its members or
                customers, but typically refers to four things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a list of email addresses</li>
                <li>the people ("subscribers") receiving mail at those addresses</li>
                <li>the publications (email messages) sent to those addresses</li>
                <li>
                    a reflector, which is a single email address that, when designated as the recipient of a message,
                    will send a copy of that message to all of the subscribers.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Gate</h3>
            <p>
                An email gate is a way for artists to collect information about their audience without the need to
                charge for the content. The artist may decide to make the whole bundle require an email address, or they
                may provide some of the bundle totally free, and designate some of the content as requiring personal
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
                This allows artists to build mailing lists for future releases or concert promotions. The listener is
                under no obligation to provide this information, and BitTorrent does not collect the information for its
                own marketing uses.
            </p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
                Email security refers to the collective measures used to secure the access and content of an email
                account or service. It allows an individual or organization to protect the overall access to one or more
                email addresses/accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                An email service provider implements email security to secure subscriber email accounts and data from
                hackers - at rest and in transit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Email security is a broad term that encompasses multiple techniques used to secure an email service.
                From an individual/end user standpoint, proactive email security measures include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong passwords</li>
                <li>Password rotations</li>
                <li>Spam filters</li>
                <li>Desktop-based anti-virus/anti-spam applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Similarly, a service provider ensures email security by using strong password and access control
                mechanisms on an email server; encrypting and digitally signing email messages when in the inbox or in
                transit to or from a subscriber email address. It also implements firewall and software-based spam
                filtering applications to restrict unsolicited, untrustworthy and malicious email messages from delivery
                to a user’s inbox.
            </p>
            <h3>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</h3>
            <p>
                SSL is the standard for Internet security. You can use SSL to communicate with LDAP clients, as well as
                with replica LDAP servers. You can use client authentication in addition to server authentication to
                provide additional security to your SSL connections. Client authentication requires that the LDAP client
                present a digital certificate that confirms the client's identity to the server before a connection is
                established.
            </p>
            <h3>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</h3>
            <p>
                TLS is designed as a successor to SSL and uses the same cryptographic methods but supports more
                cryptographic algorithms. TLS enables the server to receive secure and unsecure communications from the
                client over the default port, 389. For secure communications the client must use the StartTLS extended
                operation.
            </p>
            <h3>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)</h3>
            <p>
                Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and
                authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts,
                e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail
                communications.
            </p>
            <img src="images/pretty-good-privacy.png" alt="" />
            <h3>Signature</h3>
            <p>
                An e-mail signature is a block of text that is appended to the end of an e-mail message you send.
                Generally, a signature is used to provide the recipient with your name, e-mail address, business contact
                information, or Web site URL. Some people, however, will use a signature to sign off their e-mail
                message with a closing statement, funny quote or other message. A signature file, or sig as it is often
                called, can easily be created in most e-mail clients.
            </p>
            <h3>Spam</h3>
            <p>Email spam, also known as junk email, is unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email (spamming).</p>
            <p>
                Depending on the recipient's culture, email sent without permission—such as an "opt-in"—is likely to be
                viewed as unwelcome spam.
            </p>
            <h3>Blacklist</h3>
            <p>
                An email blacklist is a real-time database that determines if an IP address is sending email that could
                be considered spam. Many blacklists exist, all with a common goal of keeping spammy emails out of
                peoples’ inboxes.
            </p>
            <h3>Greylist</h3>
            <p>
                Greylisting is a method of defending e-mail users against spam. A mail transfer agent (MTA) using
                greylisting will "temporarily reject" any email from a sender it does not recognize. If the mail is
                legitimate, the originating server will try again after a delay, and if sufficient time has elapsed, the
                email will be accepted.
            </p>
            <h3>Spam filter</h3>
            <p>
                A spam filter is a program that is used to detect unsolicited and unwanted email and prevent those
                messages from getting to a user's inbox. Like other types of filtering programs, a spam filter looks for
                certain criteria on which it bases judgments. For example, the simplest and earliest versions (such as
                the one available with Microsoft's Hotmail) can be set to watch for particular words in the subject line
                of messages and to exclude these from the user's inbox. This method is not especially effective, too
                often omitting perfectly legitimate messages (these are called false positives) and letting actual spam
                through. More sophisticated programs, such as Bayesian filters or other heuristic filters, attempt to
                identify spam through suspicious word patterns or word frequency.
